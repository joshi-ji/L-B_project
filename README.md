# Service Executor Web Application

This project is a web-based tool designed for executing various network reconnaissance and penetration testing tasks. Built using Python and Flask, the application allows users to perform tasks such as **Nmap scanning**, **SQLmap testing**, **WPScan**, **nslookup**, **whois lookup**, **DNS lookup**, and a **"Check My IP"** feature.

## Features

- **Nmap Scanning**: Perform network discovery and security auditing.
- **SQLmap Testing**: Automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.
- **WPScan**: Scan WordPress sites for vulnerabilities.
- **nslookup**: Query DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
- **whois Lookup**: Retrieve information about the ownership of a domain name.
- **DNS Lookup**: Fetch DNS records for a specified domain.
- **Check My IP**: Display the public IP address of the user visiting the site.
